* To run our application, you need to install Android Studio and the Kotlin plugin. 
* Then, you must either use an Android device and turn it on developer mode. Or you need to configure an emulator on Android Studio.
* Now you need to open our Appli_ChuckNorrisJokes project in Android Studio.
* To launch our application, you need to press "Run App" or Alt+F10.

## Summary of our application <a name="p1"/>

We need to create an Android application that allows us to display a list of some of Chuck Norris' jokes.


## Android libraries used <a name="p2"/>

To create the whole structure of our application, we had to import a number of libraries which are :

* android
* androidx
* io
* kotlinx
* com
* retrofit2
* okhttp3

## Android components used <a name="p3"/>

To be able to realize our application, we needed different Andoid components such as : 

* TextView : it is a user interface control for displaying text.
* RecyclerView : it is an optimized and flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set.
* Adapter :  it is used to put data inside a RecyclerView.
* ConstraintLayout :it is a ViewGroup which allows you to position and size widgets in a flexible way.
* LinearLayoutManager : it is a constructor used when layout manager is set in XML by RecyclerView attribute "layoutManager".


## Context of the project <a name="p4"/>

We are in the 2nd year of the engineering cycle at ESIEE Paris in the DataScience and Artificial Intelligence stream. We are doing this project as part of a development course on Android /Kotlin smartphones. 

## Acquired skills <a name="p5"/>

This project allowed us to develop our skills in Kotlin but also in Java as it is a similar language. It allowed us to understand and know how to develop an Android application in Kotlin and to learn a lot of the features we have at our disposal.

## Areas for improvement <a name="p6"/>

* We can improve the user interface like the screen rotation.
* Additional features can be added, such as a button to share or save jokes
